## Description

2. Extract the `.zip` file to a folder of your choice.
3. [***Optional***] Right click on Toucan.exe and select `Send to > Desktop (Create Shortcut)`.
4. Run the application.
5. Enjoy!

## FAQ
**[Q] -** What versions of KSP do you support?
<br>
**[A] -** Currently we only support KSP2 (all versions) with KSP1 support still in the works.

**[Q] -** Does this work cross-platform?
<br>
**[A] -** Although this mod manager was built and tested on Windows, it ***should*** work on both MacOS and Linux, however we have done only minimal testing on both of these operating systems so there are likely to be issues.

**[Q] -** Why doesn't the client auto updater work on my operating system?
<br>
**[A] -** Currently the Mod Manager will notify you when a new update is available for the client, there is an option to choose "Auto Update" or "Manual Update". Unfortunately, the auto updater currently only works on Windows. If you are using Linux or OSX, please use the "Manual Update" option which will take you to the latest releases page on our GitHub repo.
