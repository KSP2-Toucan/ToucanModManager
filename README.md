### Installation
1. Extract the .zip file to a folder of your choice.
2. [***Optional***] Right click on Toucan.exe and select `Send to > Desktop (Create Shortcut)`.
3. Run the application.
5. Enjoy!


### Removal
To remove the Toucan Mod Manager (and all installed mods), simply navigate to your root Kerbal Space Program 2 directory (or alternatively open `Edit > Open Game Directory` within Toucan) and delete the `BepInEx` and `Toucan` folders.

### FAQ
**[Q] -** What versions of KSP do you support?
<br>
**[A] -** Currently we only support KSP2 (all versions) with KSP1 support still in the works.

**[Q] -** Does this work cross-platform?
<br>
**[A] -** Although this mod manager was built and tested on Windows, it ***should*** work on both MacOS and Linux, however we have done only minimal testing on both of these operating systems so there are likely to be issues.
